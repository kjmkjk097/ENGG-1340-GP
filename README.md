## Movie Ticketing System

Problem Statement:
Movie Industry have been loved by many people. These people will normally purchase their movie tickets in the cinema counter (offline) and directly head into watch movie. However, in many walk-in cases, there are high chance of customers missing their movie tickets on desired time due to sold out or even because they arrived late (with unexpected reasons)

For many people, it would be really convenient if they can buy or refund movie tickets through online. This system will provide an easy pathway of buying movie tickets for the customers. As well as adding/deleting/editing the records

The purpose of this project is to:
  1. Provide convenient platform for the users
  2. Allows the user to search/select movie
  3. Store user information (Creating an output file for individual us    ers who bought ticket)
  4. Display user information
  5. Allow user to delete the booking
  6. Users can add comment on Movie
